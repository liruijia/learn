% to format files for two up printing use the following style file
% feel free to modify before you install.  the units are pretty good, so
% don't fiddle much.  leaves enough room for punching holes at the top.
%
%  once latex'ed, reorganize the file using
%    dvidvi '2:0(-0.35in,-0.25in),1(4.65in,-0.25in)'   $1.dvi  twoup.dvi
%  then print using  dvi2ps -L
%  probably should package as a shell file
