%
% USAGE
%
% \documentstyle[...,askinclude,...]{...}
%
% HOW IT WORKS
%
% The askinclude style option asks the user which files to include.  If
% the user presses return, the files from the previous run are included
% automatically (except on the first run, in which case all files are
% included); if the answer is  *  all files are included; if the answer
% is  -  no files are included; otherwise the specified files (separated
% by commas, with no embedded spaces) are included.
% 
% RESTRICTIONS
%
% This file redefines \document, the command executed with \begin{document}.
% It may be incompatible with other styles that also redefine \document.
%
% The user's input is not validated.  Anything that is not a * or a - or an
% empty line is passed to \includeonly.
%
% ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
%
% Tom Scavo (scavo@cie.uoregon.edu) suggested saving the include file list
% from the previous run and a simplified user interface.
